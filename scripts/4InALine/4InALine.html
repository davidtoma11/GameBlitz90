            <h3>üéØ What‚Äôs the game about?</h3>
            <p>
                Four in a Row, also known as Connect 4, is a classic strategy game that‚Äôs simple to pick up 
                but full of exciting challenges. The game is played on a vertical 7x6 grid, where two players 
                take turns dropping colored discs ‚Äî one blue and one orange ‚Äî into columns. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to be the first to form a line of <b>four discs in a row</b>. 
                This line can go horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
                Each move matters, and every decision can bring you closer to victory or leave the door open for your opponent.
            </p>

            <h3>üïπÔ∏è How to Play</h3>
            <p>
                Players take turns choosing a column and dropping their disc into it. 
                The disc will occupy the lowest available space in that column. 
                You cannot place a disc in a full column, so think ahead!
            </p>
            <p>
                Strategy is key: you can try to create your own four-in-a-row while simultaneously blocking your opponent 
                from completing theirs. Every game feels different depending on how carefully you plan your moves.
            </p>

            <h3>üèÜ Winning the Game</h3>
            <p>
                The first player to connect <b>four of their discs in a row</b> wins the game instantly. 
                It could happen horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, so always be aware of the entire board. 
                A winning move can come out of nowhere ‚Äî the thrill is in the surprise!
            </p>
            <p>
                The best players balance offense and defense: while building their own line, they also anticipate 
                and block the opponent‚Äôs potential moves. That tension makes every match exciting and challenging.
            </p>

            <h3>ü§ù What if nobody wins?</h3>
            <p>
                If all columns are filled and neither player has four in a row, the game ends in a <b>draw</b>. 
                Both players tried their best, and the match is perfectly balanced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Draws are fair and friendly. Shake hands, reset the board, and get ready for a new round ‚Äî 
                every game is another chance to outsmart your opponent!
            </p>
