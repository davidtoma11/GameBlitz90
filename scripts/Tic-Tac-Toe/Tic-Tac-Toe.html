                <h3>üéØ What‚Äôs the game about?</h3>
                <p>
                    Tic-Tac-Toe is a timeless classic ‚Äî simple, yet surprisingly engaging.
                    The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players face off: one takes <b>X</b>
                    and the other takes <b>O</b>. Each player‚Äôs mission is to claim three spots in a row
                    before their opponent does. The row can be straight across, going down a column,
                    or even diagonally across the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the rules are easy to understand, the fun comes from the strategy.
                    Every move matters, and each round feels like a little duel of wits.
                    Will you block your opponent in time, or sneak in a clever move to claim victory?
                </p>

                <h3>üïπÔ∏è How to Play</h3>
                <p>
                    Players take turns placing their symbol (<b>X</b> or <b>O</b>) in an empty square.
                    You cannot place your symbol on a square that‚Äôs already taken.
                    Before each match begins, the game randomly decides who goes first.
                    This keeps things fair and makes every round feel fresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the board fills up, the tension builds. Each decision could lead you closer to
                    victory ‚Äî or open the door for your opponent to strike back.
                    That‚Äôs what makes Tic-Tac-Toe quick, competitive, and surprisingly addictive.
                </p>

                <h3>üèÜ Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>
                    To win, you need to line up <b>three of your own symbols in a row</b>.
                    It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs horizontal, vertical, or diagonal ‚Äî
                    as soon as you complete a line, the game ends and you are declared the winner.
                    A victory can happen suddenly, so always keep an eye on the whole board.
                    Sometimes you‚Äôll be just one move away from winning‚Ä¶ and so will your opponent!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best games are a mix of offense and defense:
                    trying to create your own winning line while blocking your rival from finishing theirs.
                    That little back-and-forth is what makes Tic-Tac-Toe exciting,
                    even though the board is so small.
                </p>

                <h3>ü§ù What if nobody wins?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not every round has a winner.
                    If the board gets completely filled and neither player has managed to make three in a row,
                    the result is a <b>draw</b>.
                    It means both players were equally clever and equally stubborn!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A tie keeps the game fair and friendly.
                    Shake hands, laugh it off, and get ready for the next match ‚Äî
                    because every new round is a fresh chance to outsmart your opponent.
                </p>
