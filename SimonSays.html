                <h3>üéÆ What‚Äôs the game about?</h3>
                <p>
                    Simon Says is a fun memory game where your goal is to repeat increasingly long sequences
                    of colors and sounds. The game challenges your attention, reflexes, and memory in a simple,
                    engaging way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each turn, the game highlights a series of colored tiles in a specific order.
                    Your task is to repeat the sequence correctly. As the rounds progress, the sequences get longer
                    and more challenging.
                </p>

                <h3>üïπÔ∏è How to Play</h3>
                <p>
                    The game features multiple colored tiles, each with its own sound.
                    When a sequence starts, pay close attention and try to repeat it by clicking the tiles in the same
                    order.
                    Every correct repetition moves you to the next round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you make a mistake, the round ends. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî every attempt helps you improve
                    your memory and reaction time. Try again and beat your previous score!
                </p>

                <h3>üèÜ Scoring & Highscore</h3>
                <p>
                    Each successfully repeated sequence gives you points. The longer the sequence, the more points you
                    earn.
                    The game keeps track of your highscore, so challenge yourself to beat it each time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compete against yourself or your friends. Who can remember the longest sequence?
                    Every new game is a chance to set a new personal best.
                </p>

                <h3>üß© Accessibility & Deaf-Friendly Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Simon Says is designed to be deaf-friendly. Each tile has its own unique visual cue and pattern,
                    so you can play the game without relying on sound.
                    The combination of color, shape, and animation ensures everyone can enjoy the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This makes it accessible for all players, letting you focus on strategy and memory
                    rather than audio cues alone.
                </p>
